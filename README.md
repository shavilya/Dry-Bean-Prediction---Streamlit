# Dry Bean Prediction - Streamlit

## Overview
Welcome to the "Dry Bean Prediction - Streamlit" repository! This project focuses on building a Streamlit application for predicting the class of dry beans based on given parameters. Whether you're a data enthusiast or just curious about the fascinating world of machine learning, this project offers insights into classification and prediction using a real-world dataset.

## Project Structure
src/: This directory contains the main source code for the Streamlit application.
data/: Here you'll find the dataset used for training and testing the model.
models/: This directory holds any pre-trained models or saved models.
requirements.txt: Lists all Python dependencies required to run the project.
README.md: You're currently reading it! This file provides an overview of the project.

## How to Use

### Clone the Repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dry-bean-prediction-streamlit.git
cd dry-bean-prediction-streamlit
```
### Install Dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Run the Streamlit App:
```
streamlit run src/app.py
```
This will start the Streamlit application locally, and you can access it through your web browser.

## Explore and Predict:
Open the provided URL in your browser and interact with the Streamlit app. Input the relevant parameters, and witness the model's predictions for the dry bean class.

## Deployment
This repository is equipped for easy deployment of the Streamlit app. You can deploy it on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or any other cloud provider of your choice. Make sure to follow the respective deployment guidelines for your chosen platform.

## Acknowledgments
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Special thanks to the Streamlit team for providing an excellent framework for building interactive web applications with Python.
